December Meeting: Jacques Fuentes on Go/DevOps

Title: Go: a "simple" systems level language

Abstract: Ruby is an elegant and highly productive language. Except when it isn't. There are two things we know Ruby (MRI) does not excel at: performance and concurrency. 

Enter Go: a compiled, fast, C-like systems level language created by folks at Google. We'll quickly cover the language internals to demonstrate why it's also elegant and highly productive. Then, Go's strengths and weaknesses will be compared to Ruby's in an effort to persuade you to learn you some Go.

Next, you'll see why Go has found its niche in DevOps by reviewing some of the new fangled OSS it powers. If we have time, I'd will talk about Go's other niche: distributed systems. I'll walk you through a distributed consensus algorithm and discuss how it is implemented in Go.

Bio: Jacques (@jpfuentes2) is a father, husband, tinkerer, and has a self-proclaimed obsession with all things programming. Because of family life and a lack of mental balance he has no other hobbies and is an extremely boring person. He will, however, gladly talk about beer, food, books, music, dogs (not cats), in no particular order.

He first taught himself PHP (let's not talk about it), then 4GL (let's *really* not talk about it), JavaScript, Ruby, and then Go. He hopes to continue adding languages to his toolbox and has recently become fascinated by distributed algorithms/systems.
