November Meeting: Daniel Farrell on Elixir

Title: Elixir -- An introduction to your next addiction

Abstract: This talk is an introduction to the Elixir language and some basic Functional Programming as well as some intro to the Erlang ecosystem. We will look at the Elixir language syntax, how to use Elixir and the technology of the Erlang community to make concurrent and distributed systems, and will also look at the emerging web ecosystem(Ecto and Dynamo) growing up around Elixir.

Bio: Daniel is a Rubyist who came to our clan through the dreaded PHP route. He taught himself PHP and Javascript to make basic web pages, and then turned himself into a developer while working for himself doing IT support. He dishes Ruby by day at Weinstein Properties, developing mostly internal facing web applications.
