        <h3>Social Time!</h3>
        <p>Come out and have a beer or two with the rest of the group while we reflect on 2012 and dream about 2013.</p>
        <p>It's been an eventful year for CVREG but now it's time to relax and prepare for the holidays. To our newest members: come on out and tell us how we can help you learn more about Ruby. To our long-time members: come on out and share your experiences. I know there are a few of us lucky enough to work full time with Ruby; how were you able to do it. Also, come with your ideas for meetings you'd like to see. But most of all: come on out and enjoy the company. See you there!</p>
        <p>Remember to bring a friend and spread the word.</p>
        
        <h3>Upcoming Meetings</h3>
        <p>A sneak peek at start of the 2013 schedule:</p>
        <h4>Russ Olsen</h4>
        <p>...of Eloquent Ruby fame will be stopping by sometime in January; we're finalizing the date and topic.</p>
        <h4>John Feminella</h4>
        <p>...will be giving us a tour of Ruby 2.0's features in February.</p>
        <h4>Ryan Castillo</h4>
        <p>...is currently penciled in for March where he'll present an updated version of his "year of TDD and BDD" talk.</p>
        <h4>April and beyond</h4>
        <p>Right now we're completely open and would love your feedback on this: what speaker would you like to see? what topic interests you? Give us your feedback on the mailing list so we can get to work making it a reality. And, please, do remember about our Hack nights!</p>
        
        <h3>Thanks!</h3>
        <p>Hopefully I speak for Jeremy and Chris when I say: thanks to everyone in this group for supporting us and sticking with us through this very eventful year. I feel we found a very good partner in 804RVA; it's been a huge benefit to having our meetings in a stable location. They've allowed us to (finally) get our Hack Night up and running.</p>
        <p>Thanks, again. And enjoy the rest of the year. Be safe, have fun, and we'll see you at the meetings...</p>
        <p>Chris Allport, Mel Riffe, Jeremy Weiland</p>
