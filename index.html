        <h3>Ruby Hack Night @ 804 RVA</h3>
        <p>
          Our regularly scheduled meeting night will be, instead, a Hack Night.
          Our speaker for the meeting proper wasn't able to make our normally
          scheduled night. We're having that on the 23rd at Dominion Digital;
          details follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come on out on the 9th and hack some Ruby code!
        <p>

        <h3>April Meeting (2 of 2): Semantic Web by Brian Sletten</h3>
        <h4>Details</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Date: Tuesday, Apr 23</li>
            <li>Time: 18:00-20:00</li>
            <li>Place: 4101 Cox Road #350, Glen Allen, VA 23060 (<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/2rPBu">map</a>)</li>

        <h3>Semantic Web</h3>
        <h4>Where is it^H^H^H^H^H When Did It Get Here?</h4>
        <p>
          Q: When will the Semantic Web get here?
          <br/>
          A: What makes you think it isn't already here?
        </p>
        <p>
          I will introduce a variety of tools and standards from the Semantic 
          Web technology stack. These are becomingly increasingly widely used on
          the Web and in organizations of all shapes and sizes. They are 
          applicable to every technology and will be key to eliminating data 
          silos of all forms. These ideas build upon trends that have become core
          to our IT strategies and it is no great leap to see how they will 
          impact our lives even more than the Web already has. As analytics, 
          machine learning and Big Data become important to us, these 
          technologies will amplify their impact more than they can on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come see how Webs of Data are important to understand, not in the future, but today.
